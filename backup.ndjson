I have also discovered that angular/devkit uses schematics for generating a tree (representing a file-folder structure) from a tree provided by the @schematics/angular package. \n\nSo, knowing this I was pretty sure that @schematics/angular would help a lot to get where I wanted to go with the changes I want to make. Before writing I try to research if someone else has already found a way to do what I want so I can skip the ‘head-banging on the wall’ part of development. \n\nAt the outset, I thought it would be a common thing that everybody uses and there would be hundreds of articles on ‘how to build your own schematic package’ and how to integrate it in Angular CLI. Unfortunately, I could only find two articles showing a little bit of how this can be accomplished. \n\nThe first was written by [Philippe Martin](https://blog.angularindepth.com/creating-your-own-application-template-for-angular-cli-95e22319cc24) where he explains how to build your own application template and the other article was written in some tutorial site (and I can’t find it at the moment). Neither of them explained exactly what I needed so I decided to implement my own package. Let me walk you through the process of what I did to get there. \n\nThe first steps are to:\n\n- Initialize a repository in GitHub\n- Create a new application with Angular CLI\n- Create a brand new npm package (node package manager) called ‘@schematics/custom’\n\nThe first step is pretty easy and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) is a tutorial on how to do it.\n\nAfter cloning the repository on my computer I execute into the folder of the repository\n\n\u003e ng new foo\n\nand my second step is finished.\n\nThe third step is a little bit difficult to understand if you are not familiar with NPM packages and how they work.\n\nPeople might not know they can create a local NPM package and install it by providing a folder location of a package without publishing into any npm server. So after knowing this I create and install a local NPM package with these commands\n\n\u003e mkdir schematics -\u0026gt; creates a folder\n\n\u003e npm init -f  -\u0026gt; initializing the NPM package\n\n\u003e cd ../foo -\u0026gt; getting back to the angular application\n\n\u003e npm install ../schematics --save-dev -\u0026gt; installs the package into the angular application\n\nI have a brand new empty NPM package installed into my _foo_ angular-cli project.\n\nNow I have to do a little change in my package.json file of the schematics package so when I install the package I would like to find it in __node_modules/schematics__ folder of the _foo_ application. In this folder are located the original angular schematics.\n\nI am going to my schematics package folder. Opening the package.json file and I am changing the __name__ property value to be **_@schematics/custom_**\n\n![](https://blog.bbogdanov.net//images/angular-schematics-package/schematics-second.png)\n\nLet's continue...\n\nNow I will copy the _component_ folder and some utils files from the official _@schematics/angular_  package to my __@schematic/custom__ package.At the moment my repo (repository) looks like this:\n\n![](https://blog.bbogdanov.net/images/angular-schematics-package/schematics-third.png)\n\nWhere ones again the _foo_ folder is the brand new angular-cli application and the ‘schematics’ folder represents my custom schematics package.\nNow let add some files to the custom component. I am going to add two files - \n\n\u003e ____name@dasherize____Actions.ts\n\nand\n\n\u003e ____name@dasherize____Reducer.ts\n\n![](https://blog.bbogdanov.net/images/angular-schematics-package/schematics-fourth.png)\n\nI am not going into too many details why all of the names have prefix **____name@dasherize____**. It is part of schematics and helps the naming of the files when they are generated.\n\nWe are ready to test it so, let's go!\n\n1. Installing the package in the angular-cli application via:\n\n\u003e npm install ../schematics –save-dev\n\n2. Running in the angular-cli application folder:\n\n\u003e ng g c test –collection=@schematics/custom\n\nbut unfortunately, there is an error about missing packages like typescript, rxjs and so on in the compiled. \n\nLet's install these packages and try again.\n\n![](https://blog.bbogdanov.net/images/angular-schematics-package/schematics-fifth.png)\n\nRepeating step one and step two and.....\n\nCongratulations we successfully created a custom schematics package.\n\nIf there is a need to set the custom collection by default, there is a command-line which can help with that:\n\n\u003e ng set defaults.schematics.collection @schematics/custom\n\nor just edit the **.angular-cli.json** file.\n\nMy work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bbogdanov/angular-with-custom-schematics) and is also under the **MIT license** so feel free to use it if you need it. \n\nI hope this helps!\n\nThanks once again to the Angular team for making such great software!","tag":[{"_key":"a18f83b2a7b1","_ref":"1dd5f24c-84f6-4fbd-8d53-21f9462245ef","_type":"reference","_weak":true}],"title":"Angular schematics package"}

Because of browsers and the issue of having the same default styles in each browser we are resetting the HTML styles for almost every element so we know exactly how each HTML tag behaves in every browser.\n2. Because we decided to treat the `\u003capp-root\u003e` as the `\u003cbody\u003e`, we void adding styles to the `\u003cbody\u003e`.\n\n## The solution we choose\n\nOur overlay container to go into the `\u003capp-root\u003e` so we can use just CSS to trick the overlay in some situations when you scroll the overlay to go under the fixed header.\n\n## Implementation\n\nKnowing how Angular works we are able to change where the overlay container is appended using the Dependency Injection.\n\nThe overlay container implementation stays behind the `class OverlayContainer` so what we can do is set a provider in our application root module to use a different instance of `OverlayContainer` when an `OverlayContainer` instance is requested.\n\n```js\n @NgModule({\n    providers: [{ provide: OverlayContainer, useClass: InAppRootOverlayContainer }]\n  })\n  export class AppModule {}\n```\n\n\u003e Ok, but how the implementation of the `InAppRootOverlayContainer` looks like?` you will say.\n\n```js\n  @Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})\n  export class InAppRootOverlayContainer extends OverlayContainer implements OnDestroy {\n      constructor(@Inject(DOCUMENT) _document: any) {\n          super(_document);\n      }\n\n      ngOnDestroy() {\n          super.ngOnDestroy();\n      }\n\n      getRootElement(): Element {\n          return this._document.querySelector('app-root');\n      }\n\n      protected _createContainer(): void {\n          super._createContainer();\n          this._appendToRootComponent();\n      }\n\n      private _appendToRootComponent(): void {\n          if (!this._containerElement) {\n              return;\n          }\n\n          const rootElement = this.getRootElement();\n          const parent = rootElement || this._document.body;\n          parent.appendChild(this._containerElement);\n      }\n  }\n```\n\nVoilà, we successfully implemented an overlay container positioned in the `\u003capp-root\u003e`.\n\nLast, we have to add 3 lines of CSS to tell the overlay goes under the header when the `MatSelect` is opened.\n\n```css\n    header, div.cdk-overlay-container mat-select-panel {\n        z-index: 1001;\n    }\n```\n\n![Angular material overlay with header fixed solution](https://blog.bbogdanov.net/images/angular-material-overlay-hach-the-overlay-container/overlay-select-header-fixed-final.gif)\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nHere is the\n[StackBlitz example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-overlay-in-app-root)","tag":[{"_key":"ed3be601137a","_ref":"1dd5f24c-84f6-4fbd-8d53-21f9462245ef","_type":"reference","_weak":true}],"title":"Angular Material Overlay - hack the overlay container","urlName":"angular-material-overlay-hack-overlay-container"}

We had to import a bunch of functions like `switchMap`, `toPromise`, `catch` and `Observable` to make the Http service work as we wanted to.\n\nNow with HttpClient, we have all these imports go away. The HttpClient requests are returning **_Observables_** and we do not need to make them observable as we did before. Also, the angular team introduced in v4.3 the request **_interceptor_**. We can define as much as we want interceptors that could change every sent request before reaching the back-end. They are like a middleware where every request has to pass before going to the back-end.\n\nSounds great right?\n\nWell, it is but from my experience middleware usage has to be clear.\n\nI started a project where I wanted to use the HttpClient. I was curious is there a way I can tell to every request that there is a variable which knows where the back-end is. That way I do not need to tell in every request which variable to use for the back-end location. So far I see many people on the web writing the interceptors are this kind of a place.\n\nI have to disagree with this. As an OO guy, the **_Inheritance_** is the best way to handle that situation.\n\nBut before going ahead I would like to implement one interceptor which handles the request URL property.\n\n```js\nimport {Injectable} from '@angular/core';\nimport {HttpEvent, HttpHandler, HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest} from '@angular/common/http';\nimport {Observable} from 'rxjs/Observable';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class ServerLocationInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {\n\n  public constructor() {\n  }\n\n  public intercept(req: HttpRequest\u003cany\u003e,\n            next: HttpHandler): Observable\u003cHttpEvent\u003cany\u003e\u003e {\n\n    let clonedRequest: HttpRequest\u003cany\u003e = req.clone({\n        url: 'https://someurl.example/' + req.url\n      });\n\n    return next.handle(clonedRequest);\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nIn the example, we are adding the server location on every request made to the server. When we want to make a request to a RESTful server we will just add the endpoint we want to reach and that's good. What happens if we want to add an additional server location? We will need to implement an if statements in the interceptor. It will work but it will become a little confusing when you get back to it after 3 months. The interceptors are good for something else.\n\nThe interceptors could handle something like Authentication. They are a great approach to handle if there is a token or cookie so they can change a little bit of the request by adding an additional header.\n\nBut the authentication part is also on every request so doesn't it goes in the Inheritance part as well?\n\nYes, it could go there, but let me show you what I mean.\n\n```js\n/**\n * Created by bbogdanov on 10/9/17.\n */\n\nimport {HttpClient,

}\n}\n```\n\nIn the first example, you are handling the request headers from only one function. If you want to change a little bit the interceptor it won’t affect the ApplicationHttpClient implementation. In the second there are four functions that are handling the authentication part. If you want to add more headers in every request you have to add four more statements instead of only one.\n\nSo after we introduced several best practice ideas, how we actually extend the HttpClient with our own functionality? Well, in the second code example it is pretty much it. We only need to add a few more functions so the angular could understand it and use it.\n\nWe have to add the extended service to the main module(or the modules which you want to use it only)\n\n```js\nimport {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport {NgModule} from '@angular/core';\nimport {AppComponent} from './app.component';\nimport {HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, HttpClient, HttpClientModule} from '@angular/common/http';\nimport {AuthInterceptor} from './services/auth-interceptor';\nimport {ApplicationHttpClient, applicationHttpClientCreator} from './services/http-client';\nimport {TokenService} from './services/token.service';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    HttpClientModule,\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    // Provide the Authentication interceptor\n    {\n        provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, \n        useClass: AuthInterceptor,\n        multi: true\n    },\n\n    //Provide the extended HttpClient\n    {\n      provide: ApplicationHttpClient,\n      useFactory: applicationHttpClientCreator,\n      deps: [HttpClient]\n    },\n\n    //It is not required but it is good practise to have one.\n    TokenService\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}\n```\n\nThis is it. We successfully extended the HttpClient. We also had the chance to implement one interceptor and handle a simple authentication.","tag":[{"_key":"4e02f29bce66","_ref":"1dd5f24c-84f6-4fbd-8d53-21f9462245ef","_type":"reference","_weak":true}],"title":"Extending HttpClient"}

One of the main processes is the **_implementation_** one. ITIL(Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is known as the **_Application Development _** process. Unfortunately, the process has no defined steps which you can follow and that's what I am going to define and give hints on why.\n\nThe steps are **three** and they are:\n\n - Development\n - Unit testing\n - Continuous integration\n\n\nBefore you begin with the code implementation, you need to be aware of how changes are going to be managed. You need a well-defined **Change Managment**. There are a lot of source control services like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/) that can help your organization or team to manage the code of the product. Also, you need a well-defined strategy on how to use these source control services through the process.\n\n### **Development**\n\nThe **Development** step is to implement new functionality into the product. In this step, you write some code, and if it works you store it to the main code store or code repository.\n\nThe need of owning a good development environment is necessary for this step because as a developer you need to feel comfortable while working. Nowadays the tools that you need to develop a functionality are to have an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) and a [debugger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger) which runs your code and you can see live what your code is doing. When the functionality is ready it has to be pushed to the code repository. Before the push, you have to do some basic steps and they must be already defined in the Code management process where your code process strategy is implemented and best practices are written.\n\nSo let's say your code is pushed to the main repository but your changes broke one feature functionality because you changed one function implementation. Well obviously you have to go and fix it, but can you prevent that from happening in the future? Yes and here it comes the** unit testing** part.\n\n### **Unit testing**\n\nSo when we need to talk about **a good **implementation process, we definitely have to mention the testing part. There are two types of testing - unit, and integration. There is a big difference between unit and integration testing and there are many books like [The Art of Unit Testing ](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Unit-Testing-Roy-Osherove/dp/1617290890/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1504868023\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=the+art+of+unit+testing) where this difference is explained and shown by examples.\n\nThere are also two types of how you can test units - manual and automatic. In this post, I will talk about the automatic ones.\n\nIt is so boring to test manually every single time before committing your changes if something in the project has been broken after your functionality implementation.\n\nLet's say your project is like 30000 code long. Before each commit, you have to spend 5 or more hours to test if all functions are doing their job correctly manually. It will feel like...\n\n![](https://blog.bbogdanov.net//images/product-implementation/old-man-time-watch.jpeg)\n\nSo we have to automate them. There is at least one testing framework for every modern language which gives you the opportunity to test your units like [NUnit](http://nunit.org/), [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/), [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io) and so on.\n\nBy testing your units you will be able to keep track of the product functionality. Let's say someones broke or changed the functionality of a single unit. You will understand right after running the unit tests that a unit functionality has been changed because the unit test will fail. If a unit test fails, you know a function is broken and better check where this unit has been used.\n\n## Test your units to protect yourself from creating issues. \n\nAlso, the unit test protects you from creating too much dependent functionality. Let's say a single unit test is like 100 lines of code long and also includes 2 or more assert functions. Like I said previously, there are two types of testing - unit testing and integration testing. If a unit test tests more than one single function is more acquired to be an integration test.\n\nI wrote a quick example in [Plunker](https://plnkr.co/edit/6qyDf0) for how integration test and a unit test could look like.\n\nRight after your unit tests are done you are good to commit your changes into the official code repository.\n\nAfter the commit, you have to spend like 30 minutes to go build the application and deploy it on your company product test environment so the QAs could check if the functionality you created works as expected and meet business requirements. But why you have to spend 30 or more minutes every time when you change the functionality or create one to build and deploy it in the test environment? Can you automate this process? Yes and here it comes the **continuous integration** part.\n\n### **Continuous Integration**\n\nContinuous integration will help you to create an effective and well-defined deployment process. But In this post, I will not talk about the entire deployment process because it is defined at **Release and Deployment Management**  process of ITIL. I am going to discuss the part of the deployment process which is related to the application development work.\n\nAfter every commit, the CI should run automatically and this is the great part. It should build the product and run the unit tests ones more to check if your application is good to continue with the deployment part.\n\nThe computers are like humans - they make mistakes and sometimes on your computer, the application built correctly but on the CI machine didn't. If something is going wrong on the CI machine it means that the deployment process is not correct and well-defined and you have to fix it.\n\nOne way of removing the possibility of the application to be built correctly on your machine, but not on the CI one is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Anyway, it is a good practice the CI to do the build and run the unit tests one more time to ensure the product is going to be deployed correctly, but if the build fails, the deployment process will not be triggered and you will not deploy a broken product and that is great because the client will not see a broken product on his production environment where real people might work or use the product!\n\nSo after all what are these three steps after all giving us:\n\n![](https://blog.bbogdanov.net/images/product-implementation/application_development_process.png)\n\n- Development process - When following the change management process, you will create fewer conflicts when committing and do not actually commit to covering with tests the functionality you already created.\n- Unit tests - Less broken pieces in the product implementation, run them before committing the changes into the main repo, so you prevent broken features to go into the main repository and also prevent the CI to fail the build step. Time-saving.\n- Continuous integration - Ensures your project is ready to continue with the deployment in the test environment where the QAs can check the newest functionality. Time-saving.\n\nI will keep developing this article so if you have any suggestions what steps could be added to the **Application Development** process, feel free to share it in the comments.\n\nSpecial thanks to [Jordan Georgiev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordangeorgiev/), [Yani Popov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yani-popov-82070032/) and [Petar Ivanov ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petar-ivanov-3453655b/) for helping me create this post.\n\nThank you for reading the article!","tag":[{"_key":"cc7bed0fb1d9","_ref":"2c8eb1a5-c853-4eac-a97e-76130baef1c5","_type":"reference","_weak":true},{"_key":"8ed21817b501","_ref":"ada1ec90-2f54-4bfb-8d3a-eeb76f15e561","_type":"reference","_weak":true}],"title":"Application Development"}
